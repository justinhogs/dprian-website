      <p>Christian Yu (born 6 September 1990), known professionally as DPR Ian,[3] is an Australian singer, rapper, and director[4][5] based in South Korea. He is a former member of Yedang Entertainment boy group C-Clown, which was active between 2012 and 2015. Yu made his solo debut under his co-founded label Dream Perfect Regime (DPR) with the digital single "So Beautiful" on October 26, 2020. His first studio album Moodswings In To Order was released on July 29, 2022.[6] He was the 10th most streamed Kpop Male Solo Artist Globally on Spotify in 2022.[7][8]</p>
      <p>DPR Ian was born in Sydney, Australia on September 6, 1990, and was raised by his mother after his parents separated when he was young. Yu attended Wollongong High School of the Performing Arts and played in a heavy metal band, where he was influenced by the musicals and circuses he attended as a child.[9][10] In 2008, when he was 18, he started uploading videos to his YouTube channel, going by the name of B Boy B.yu. After graduating from high school, Yu studied science and art at the University of Sydney for one year before dropping out. He then moved to South Korea to pursue dancing, initially having no intention of becoming a K-pop idol. However, this changed when he was street cast by an entertainment agency; when he auditioned, he couldnâ€™t sing but he was able to impress with his dancing abilities.</p>
